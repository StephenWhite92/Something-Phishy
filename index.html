        <h1>COMPLETE THE TRAINING GAME TO ENTER TO WIN A $5 AMAZON GIFT CARD!</h1>
        <p>We are a group of five team members completing our senior capstone project at the University of Missouri in the Information Technology Department.
            We are doing research on the use of QR codes, like the one you just scanned, and their potential for abuse by hackers.
            Your help with our research will be greatly appreciated and all participants that complete our game and survey will be entered in for a chance to win 1 of 5 $5 Amazon giftcards.
            <br />Thank you for your time and have a great day. <br />-The Something Phishy Team</p>
